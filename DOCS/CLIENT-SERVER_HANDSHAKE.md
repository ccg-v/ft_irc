IRSSI Behavior

    Initial Connection and Protocol Messages:
    When IRSSI connects, it doesn’t just send a single message. Instead, it begins a negotiation with the server:
        It first sends a CAP LS request (capabilities negotiation), and then it may follow with commands like JOIN or others as part of the registration process.
        Your server echoes back these messages (as it’s acting like a simple echo server) instead of processing them as part of an IRC protocol handshake.

    IRSSI Warnings:
    IRSSI expects a proper IRC server handshake and protocol responses. For example:
        The CAP LS response should trigger further capability negotiation.
        The JOIN command (or its echo) might be interpreted incorrectly.
        Because your server is only echoing data and not following the IRC protocol, IRSSI complains that it doesn’t receive the proper confirmations (or even any acknowledgment) for the commands it sends. This results in warnings such as "Unhandled CAP subcommand" and critical errors related to missing or unexpected data (e.g., assertions about nick being NULL).

    The “Not connected to server” Message:
    After IRSSI sends its initial commands (like CAP LS and JOIN), it waits for appropriate protocol responses. Since your server is just echoing the messages and not implementing the IRC protocol, IRSSI eventually determines that the connection isn’t behaving like a real IRC server, leading it to conclude that it’s "Not connected" properly.

To evolve your server from a simple echo server to a working IRC server, you might consider these steps:

    Implement the IRC Handshake and Registration:
        When a client connects, you should send an initial welcome message or a series of messages according to the IRC protocol. This typically includes numeric replies that acknowledge registration.
        Handle the registration commands (e.g., NICK, USER) and respond with the appropriate numeric messages (like 001 for welcome).

    Capability Negotiation (CAP):
        Properly process CAP commands like CAP LS, CAP REQ, etc. This means parsing the client's capability requests and responding with the expected values or acknowledgments.
        Even if you choose to ignore some capabilities, you should respond in a way that doesn’t cause the client to crash or produce errors.

    Command Parsing and Handling:
        Instead of simply echoing back whatever is received, parse the incoming messages.
        Identify and process commands such as JOIN, PRIVMSG, etc. For commands that your server does not support, you might need to send an error message or simply ignore them.
        Manage message boundaries carefully, ensuring you process complete messages terminated by CRLF.

    State Management:
        Maintain a list of connected clients and their states (e.g., registered, authenticated, in a channel).
        Handle proper disconnection, reconnection, and cleanup of client state.

    Protocol Compliance:
        Follow the IRC RFC (e.g., RFC 2812 for the IRC protocol) to determine the exact sequence of messages and responses required during registration and operation.
        Even minimal compliance will help clients like IRSSI interact without triggering errors.

The core IRC registration process is defined in RFC 2812—primarily in Section 3.1 ("Connection Registration"). However, there are a few points to note:

    Basic Registration (RFC 2812):
    According to RFC 2812, a client must send at least the following commands:
        NICK <nickname>
        USER <username> <hostname> <servername> :<real name>

    The server is then expected to send a series of numeric replies. Common replies include:
        001 (RPL_WELCOME)
        002 (RPL_YOURHOST)
        003 (RPL_CREATED)
        004 (RPL_MYINFO)

    This basic sequence is outlined in Section 3.1 of RFC 2812. It doesn’t spell out every step in a detailed “flow chart” but makes it clear that until both NICK and USER are received and validated, the client is not considered fully registered. Only after registration is complete can the client issue most other commands.

    Additional Registration and Capabilities Negotiation:
    Modern IRC clients (such as IRSSI or HexChat) often support additional negotiation—such as capability (CAP) negotiation, SASL authentication, or other extensions. These are not described in RFC 2812; they come from later extensions (for example, IRCv3 specifications).
        CAP Negotiation: Clients may send a CAP LS to list server capabilities and then request specific ones with CAP REQ.
        SASL/Other Auth Methods: Some clients support secure authentication methods which involve further exchanges.

    Because these extensions aren’t part of RFC 2812, you won’t find a “one size fits all” sequence for them in that RFC.

    Differences Among Clients:
        Full-fledged IRC clients (IRSSI, HexChat, etc.):
        They follow the RFC 2812 basics for registration (sending NICK and USER) and then proceed to negotiate capabilities and authentication if supported. Their sequences will include the additional CAP commands and the associated responses.
        Minimal Tools (Netcat):
        When using netcat, you aren’t following the full IRC client protocol. Netcat simply sends data (lines) without the required registration commands. If you connect with netcat, you’re likely just testing basic connectivity or echo behavior; the server sees arbitrary text rather than a full registration sequence. This is why you see a difference in behavior and why netcat might not trigger the same responses as a dedicated IRC client.
